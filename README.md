#Notes
Originally, this project was scoped to be a public chrome extension that users could just install and authenticate. However, Nest has made the approval process for using the API simply too involved for me to give that kind of time. So, it's open sourced...

##setup
you will need to add your own credentials from both Google and Nest:

###Google Developer Account
1. [create your developer account](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard)
2. add a product
3. note the `Item ID` as you will need this for the nest developer call back url

###Nest Developer Account

1. create your developer account
2. add a product
3. note the details

4. add your `Redirect URI` - `https://{your_GOOGLE_ItemID}.chromiumapp.org/provider_cb`

###Update the source

1. in `/app/manifest.js`, update the specifics to your google app product
1. in the `/index.js` file, update your nest product id and secret

```
var app = {
	KEY_ACCESS_TOKEN : "access_token",
	PRODUCT_ID: "XXX_",
	SECRET: "XXX_",
    firebase: new Firebase('wss://developer-api.nest.com')
}
```

## install something to watch less when compiled
* `npm install`
* cd to root of project
* `watch-less -d app/css/ -e .css` - watches for less
* open another shell
* `npm start` - watches for browserify
